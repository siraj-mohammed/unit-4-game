# Crystals Collector

How good is your arithmetic? How about your memory?

Play this game and find out!

You will be given a random number at the start of the game. That will be your target score.

There are four crystals each of which has a certain value. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the target score exactly. You lose the game if your total score goes above the target.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time the game starts, a new random number will be generated and the value of each crystal will be changed.

Ready? Let's play Crystals Collector!
